## Why This Phase

D108 (`.steering/DECISIONS.md`) recorded a vision at the user's request on
2026-07-08, explicitly as a NOTE ONLY — "don't just start coding from this,"
because it spans many crates and needed real scoping first. This phase is
that scoping, done by first auditing what already exists (not assumed from
the note) rather than designing from scratch.

**The audit's key finding, which reshapes this phase's real size**: most of
the "new infrastructure" the vision implies already exists in the codebase,
just unwired from the paths real apps actually use:

- `rosace-scroll` already has a real momentum/friction physics engine
  (`physics.rs::MomentumState`, `ScrollPhysics::Momentum`) — but the actual
  `ScrollView` widget apps use (`rosace-widgets/src/tree/scroll_view.rs`)
  talks to a *different*, instant-offset `ScrollController` instead. The
  momentum engine is orphaned — referenced only by its own crate's doctest.
- `rosace-nav-anim` already has `NavigatorAnimated`/`ScreenTransition`
  (slide/fade transitions, spring-backed) — but the real navigation path
  (`rosace-nav::Navigator`/`ScreenNav`) never references the crate at all.
  Also orphaned.
- The theme-global animation primitive apps actually use today,
  `PaintCtx::animate_to` (`rosace-widgets/src/tree/mod.rs:615`), already
  respects `ThemeData.animation.enabled`/`duration_ms` correctly and is the
  right foundation to extend, not replace. `Switch`/`Checkbox`/`Radio`/
  `SegmentedControl` already animate through it.

So this phase is mostly **wiring existing engines into the real widget
paths**, plus two genuinely new pieces of animation (press feedback, image
fade-in) built on the existing `animate_to` primitive — a materially smaller
lift than "build momentum physics and a transition system from scratch"
would have been.

## Out of Scope (deliberately, not silently dropped)

- **Per-category `AnimationConfig`.** Today there's one global
  `duration_ms` for all animated widgets. D108's note flags per-category
  duration/curve (press vs. scroll vs. nav vs. fade) as a likely future
  need, but nothing in Steps 1-4 actually requires it — all four reuse the
  theme's single global duration, matching the four existing `animate_to`
  callers. Revisit only if a real need surfaces while building these
  steps, not preemptively.
- **List-item enter/exit animation.** Needs real diffing of list identity
  across rebuilds — a meaningfully different problem from scalar-easing
  the four steps below share. Its own future step/phase.
- **The animation-authoring framework / ready-to-use library.** A
  product-surface-sized effort in its own right, best scoped AFTER this
  phase's default-animation foundation is solid and has revealed what
  primitives actually get reused enough to warrant a library.

## Platform never hardcodes behavior (added 2026-07-09, governs Steps 2/3/5)

Stated explicitly by the user and already the project's own D105 principle
(`rosace-core/src/platform.rs:1-7`): widgets/engines never hard-branch on
platform (`if platform == Ios { ... }`). Platform only ever selects a
DEFAULT preset through the existing theme-resolution mechanism
(`Themes::platform(Platform::Ios, cupertino())`), and every default must
be explicitly overridable by app code regardless of the detected platform
— an Android app that wants iOS-style bounce scroll just sets it. Steps
2 and 3 resolve their platform defaults through `ThemeData`'s existing
type-keyed `ext` map (`rosace-theme/src/theme.rs:83-86`, D105 Phase 23
Step 4 — built exactly for this: "lets a custom widget stash and read its
own theme-style struct without editing this type"), the same shape
`AppBarStyle` already proved out — not a new mechanism.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Press/tap feedback
`Button::paint` does instant, un-eased hover color-lift and has no
distinct pressed state at all; `Pressable`'s own doc comment says
press/hover visual feedback "arrives with the interaction-states work" —
this step is that work, scoped to visual feedback only (not a new gesture
system). Adds a per-node "press amount" driven through `animate_to`
(0→1 on press-down, back to 0 on release/cancel) to ease a color/opacity
lift on `Button`, `ListTile`, `Chip`, and other `Pressable`-driven widgets.

Exit: pressing a button in a running app shows a smooth eased color
transition (not an instant snap) on press and release, verified via real
interaction, and snaps instantly when `set_animations(false)`.

**Landed.** New dispatcher-owned `TreeNode::pressed: bool`
(`render_tree.rs`, mirrors `hovered` exactly) + `RenderTree::set_pressed`
+ `PaintCtx::pressed()`. Wired into `rosace/src/engine.rs`'s real
MouseDown/MouseUp handlers — MouseDown resolves the target via the same
`hover_test` the existing hover-tracking MouseMove handler already uses
(deliberately reused, not a new hit-resolution path — lower risk than
threading node ids through `hit_test`'s recursive scroll-transform
wrapping). `Button` and `ListTile` (the two widgets that already called
`ctx.hovered()` for their own styling) now ease a single "emphasis" scalar
through `animate_to` across three levels — idle (0.0), hover (0.5, matches
the old flat lift exactly, so no visual regression when animations are
off), press (1.0, double the hover lift, so a tap reads as visually
distinct). `Chip` was investigated and correctly left alone — unlike
Button/ListTile it has no `on_press`/hover wiring of its own; it's only
interactive via the external `.on_press()` (`Pressable`), which paints the
child on a *different* render-tree node than the one press/hover state
lands on. Giving `Pressable`-wrapped widgets press feedback is a real,
separate architectural question (does `Pressable` need to expose its own
node's interaction state down to the child?) — flagged, not solved here.

**Verified for real**: two new integration tests in `rosace/src/
engine.rs` drive an actual headless `FrameEngine` (the same struct the
real desktop/web/iOS/Android paths all use) with synthetic
`InputEvent::MouseDown`/`MouseUp`, exactly like `rosace-web-seo`/Phase 25
used a headless `FrameEngine` for build-time SEO extraction — not a
render-tree-only unit test. One confirms `MouseDown` sets `pressed` on a
real node and `MouseUp` clears it; the other confirms the eased scalar
actually advances toward the 1.0 press target over successive frames (with
a synthetic `frame_dt` for determinism, not real wall-clock time — avoids
a flaky test whose convergence speed depends on machine speed) and
converges to 1.0. Also scaffolded a fresh `rsc new`-generated desktop app
and ran it for real (screenshot confirms correct rendering, no visual
regression). **Honest gap**: this environment has no native-desktop GUI
automation tool (no `cliclick`/Quartz installed, no computer-use tool for
non-browser windows) to literally move the OS mouse cursor and hold a
button down for a live screenshot sequence — unlike Phase 25's Chrome
automation, which was available for the web target. What WAS verified
instead is the exact same dispatch code a real click would run, driven
with synthetic events through the real `FrameEngine`, plus visual
confirmation the app still renders correctly. If a literal physical-click
screenshot sequence is wanted, it needs either a human at the mouse or an
explicitly-authorized install of a click-automation tool.
Full `cargo build --workspace` / `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`
clean (zero failures) after this step.

### Step 2 — Wire real momentum + bounce scroll (expanded 2026-07-09)
`ScrollView` currently writes scroll offset instantly via
`ScrollController::scroll_by`. Wires `rosace-scroll`'s existing
`MomentumState`/`ScrollPhysics::Momentum` in: on drag release with
residual velocity, decay the offset via friction each frame until it
settles or a new drag interrupts it. Respects `theme.animation.enabled`
(disabled → instant stop at release, no coast).

Adds `ScrollPhysics::Bounce { friction, spring_stiffness }` (overscroll
resists then springs back — the iOS feel; Android's overscroll glow is a
separate visual, not a different physics model, and is out of scope). The
default physics resolves per-platform via a new `ScrollStyle` ext struct
on `ThemeData` (`cupertino()` → `Bounce`, `material()`/desktop/web →
`Momentum`) but an explicit `.physics(...)` on `ScrollView` always wins —
see the platform rule above.

Exit: a real drag-and-release in a running scrollable list visibly
continues scrolling with decreasing speed (or bounces back, if
`Bounce`-configured) after the pointer lifts, verified by interacting with
a real running app; an explicit override to the non-default physics works
regardless of detected platform; stops instantly when animations are
disabled.

**Landed, with a real scope correction mid-implementation.** Investigating
the real input model (not assumed) found `ScrollView` had NO drag-to-pan
gesture at all — only wheel/trackpad `Scroll` events existed; nothing
turned a mouse/touch drag into a scroll offset change. User confirmed:
build drag-to-pan first (with velocity tracked from the REAL drag speed,
not an assumed constant), then momentum/bounce on top — this step ended up
delivering both, not just wiring existing physics onto an existing
gesture. Also found a real layer-rule conflict: `rosace-theme` (Layer 4)
can't depend on `rosace-scroll` (Layer 5), so `cupertino()`/`material()`
can't construct a `ScrollStyle` ext value directly. Resolved by keeping the
platform-default computation as ONE pure function inside `rosace-scroll`
itself (`ScrollStyle::default_for_platform`, reads `rosace-core::Platform`
which IS a lower layer) — an app's theme `ext` override and an explicit
per-`ScrollView` `.physics(...)` both still take priority over it, so the
"platform is a default-picker only, never hardcoded" rule holds exactly as
designed, just resolved in a different crate than first planned.

New `ScrollController` methods (`rosace-scroll/src/controller.rs`):
`drag_delta`/`end_drag` (streamed absolute drag position → per-move delta),
`track_velocity`/`velocity()` (real px/s from the actual offset delta each
frame — not assumed), `apply_momentum` (rubber-band-aware offset step,
resists overscroll under `Bounce`, hard-clamps otherwise), `settle_bounce`
(exponential ease back to bounds once velocity settles, same shape as
`animate_to`), `coast` (one frame of decay-or-settle, orchestrating
`MomentumState`), `stop_coasting` (hard stop for the animations-disabled
case). `ScrollView::paint_base` wires these together via `ctx.on_press_at`
(the same positional-hit mechanism sliders use) and reuses Step 1's
`ctx.pressed()` — no new engine.rs plumbing needed, since declaring the
drag region makes `hover_test` (which Step 1's MouseDown handler already
calls) pick it up for free. Scoped to the base (CPU) scroll path only —
the GPU-layer path's separate non-reactive offset channel is flagged as
real follow-up, not silently extended.

**Two real bugs found and fixed via the headless `FrameEngine` integration
tests** (same technique as Step 1 — synthetic `MouseDown`/`MouseMove`/
`MouseUp` through the real engine dispatch, not controller-level unit
tests alone):
1. **Missing sign inversion.** The first implementation applied the raw
   drag delta directly, so dragging up moved the offset the wrong way
   (content chasing the cursor instead of following it, backwards from
   every real scrollable surface). Fixed by negating, matching the
   existing wheel-scroll callback's own sign convention exactly.
2. **A spurious "fresh drag" reset caused by the well-known 1-frame lag**
   between an input event and `ctx.pressed()` observing it (the same lag
   `ctx.hovered()` already has). The first implementation reset
   `last_drag_point` whenever it saw `was_pressed` transition false→true —
   but because of the lag, that transition is observed on the SAME frame
   as the drag's first `MouseMove`, one frame after `MouseDown`'s own
   immediate callback invocation had already correctly established the
   drag's starting point. The reset wiped that baseline out from under the
   very next `drag_delta` call, making the first move of every drag
   silently do nothing. Root-caused via targeted print debugging (atom ids
   and pointer addresses to rule out a sharing bug first) after an
   isolated standalone `Atom<Option<T>>` round-trip test proved the atom
   primitive itself was correct — the bug was in this step's own new
   control-flow logic, not the state layer. Fixed by removing the
   redundant reset entirely; `end_drag` on release (which does NOT have
   this lag problem, since it fires from the same frame's dispatch that
   also updates `pressed`) is the only reset actually needed.

**A third, unrelated pre-existing bug found along the way**: running the
new tests alongside the existing suite intermittently failed with
`disabling_animations_stops_coasting_immediately_on_release` racing
`drag_pans_content_and_momentum_coasts_after_release` — `rosace_theme`'s
theme is a process-wide `GlobalAtom`, and `cargo test` runs test functions
on parallel threads by default, so one test's `set_animations(false)`
could flip the flag mid-coast for the other. Fixed with a `static ...
Mutex` guard around both tests (`rosace/src/engine.rs`) — confirmed
stable across repeated runs afterward. **While chasing this down, found
the SAME class of bug already existing, unrelated to this phase's own
code**: `rosace-state/src/frame_scheduler.rs`'s
`request_frame_sets_flag`/`take_clears_flag`/`multiple_requests_collapse_to_one`
tests race each other the same way and are flaky under
`cargo test --workspace`'s full parallel load (always pass in isolation).
Logged in `CRATE_CONTRACTS.md`'s Known Issues (#8) rather than fixed here
— pre-existing, outside this step's scope, not introduced by this work.

**Verified for real**: the two new `rosace/src/engine.rs` integration
tests (real `FrameEngine`, synthetic but real input events) cover drag
panning content in real time, momentum continuing after release
proportional to actual drag speed, and animations-disabled producing an
immediate hard stop with zero coast. Full `cargo build --workspace` /
`cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` clean throughout (the one
exception, `rosace-state`'s pre-existing parallel-test flake, is
unrelated and logged separately — `CRATE_CONTRACTS.md` Known Issue #8).

**Status: PAUSED with a known unresolved issue, not claimed as fully
working — see `CRATE_CONTRACTS.md` Known Issue #9.** Real on-device
testing (not just the headless engine tests above) went through many
rounds against a real running macOS app: drag-to-pan direction, a
dt-unit-mismatch bug, frame-rate-dependent friction decay, unbounded
overscroll, a stale scrollbar read, a per-frame-flag wheel-gating bug, an
overscroll-recovery timing bug, and a velocity clamp — each confirmed and
fixed with a regression test (44 tests in `rosace-scroll` total). The
LAST round used a real screen recording (frame-extracted with a one-off
Swift/AVFoundation script) to root-cause a genuine oscillation to a real
platform quirk: macOS delivers trackpad momentum as the OS's own event
stream after the user's fingers lift, and winit 0.30.13 collapses that
into the same event phase as real finger movement (confirmed by reading
winit's own macOS backend source), so ROSACE's own momentum system was
fighting the OS's. The fix (wheel input no longer injects synthetic
velocity, applies directly instead) changed the failure mode but did not
fully resolve it in the reporter's live testing. Per explicit user
direction, this is being logged and left open rather than pursued
further right now — drag-to-pan and the underlying momentum primitives
are solid; `ScrollPhysics::Bounce`'s real-trackpad feel specifically is
not. `ScrollPhysics::Momentum` (the default for every platform except
iOS/macOS) was not implicated in any of the live testing.

**A second, distinct real-user report (2026-07-09, via the `demo_app`
example built for D108 Steps 1-5's showcase): drag tracking itself lags
behind the cursor when the drag is moderately fast** — "if we move the
mouse a bit fast, not too fast, it slowly follows" — not the settle-time
bounce jitter above, and not yet root-caused. `MouseMove` dispatch (
`rosace/src/engine.rs`'s `active_drag` handling) forwards every event in
the frame's batch to the drag callback with no visible throttling in the
dispatch code itself, so the likely-but-UNVERIFIED suspects are:
winit/OS-level `CursorMoved` coalescing under fast movement, or the
paint loop not repainting once per real dispatched `MouseMove` (a
render-frequency question, not an input-dispatch one) — both need real
interactive reproduction (ideally a screen recording, same technique
that root-caused the bounce jitter above) to actually confirm rather
than guess. Logged, not fixed — per this project's own discipline, a
blind change here would be exactly the kind of unverified "workaround"
this phase has repeatedly had to walk back. See `CRATE_CONTRACTS.md`
Known Issue #10.

### Step 3 — Wire real nav transitions (expanded 2026-07-09)
`rosace-nav`'s `Navigator`/`ScreenNav` has zero references to
`rosace-nav-anim` today — pushes/pops are instant. Wires
`NavigatorAnimated`/`ScreenTransition` into the real push/pop path,
default-on, respecting `theme.animation.enabled`.

The default transition STYLE resolves per-platform via a new
`NavTransitionStyle` ext struct on `ThemeData` (same mechanism as Step 2's
`ScrollStyle`), always overridable via an explicit `Navigator::
transition(...)` call regardless of detected platform.

Exit: pushing/popping a screen in a real running app shows the
platform-default transition with zero app-level wiring (`rsc new`'s
generated Home→Counter navigation is the concrete test case), an explicit
override to a different style works regardless of platform, off entirely
when animations are globally disabled.

**Landed, with a real architecture correction found before writing any
code.** A fresh audit found `ScreenNav<R>` (what real apps actually use —
`rsc new`'s generated `app.rs` calls it, built through the real
component-hook system) and `Navigator`/`NavigatorAnimated` (what had the
transition math) are two COMPLETELY SEPARATE, non-overlapping
implementations — `NavigatorAnimated` wraps `Navigator`, not `ScreenNav`,
and has zero consumers outside its own tests. Worse, `rosace-nav-anim`
already depends on `rosace-nav`, so `rosace-nav` could not depend back on
`rosace-nav-anim` for the transition math without a circular crate
dependency — confirmed by reading both `Cargo.toml`s directly, not
assumed. Resolved by MOVING (not duplicating) `SlideDirection`/
`TransitionStyle`/`ScreenTransition` (14 existing tests, carried over
unchanged) from `rosace-nav-anim` down into `rosace-nav` itself;
`rosace-nav-anim/src/transition.rs` is now a one-line `pub use
rosace_nav::transition::*;` so `NavigatorAnimated` (left otherwise
untouched — still not wired to anything real, same as Step 2's precedent
of extending the actually-used type rather than the orphaned parallel
one) keeps compiling against the same public names.

`ScreenNav<R>` gained: transition state (`Arc<Mutex<ScreenTransition>>`),
a `previous: Atom<Option<R>>` for building the outgoing screen's widget,
and platform-default style resolution (`NavTransitionStyle::
default_for_platform` — iOS/macOS/Android → `Slide`, Windows/Linux/Web →
`Fade` — a pure lookup, three-layer override chain identical in shape to
Step 2's `resolve_physics`: explicit `.transition_style(...)` > app theme
`ext` > platform default). `push` triggers `Slide(Left)` (new screen
enters from the right, matching real iOS/Android drill-in — confirmed by
reading `SlideDirection::Left.enter_from() == (1.0, 0.0)` directly, not
assumed); `pop` triggers the reverse, `Slide(Right)`; `replace` fades.

New widget `ScreenTransitionView` (`rosace-widgets/src/tree/
screen_transition_view.rs`) is NOT generic over the app's route enum —
takes only two already-built widgets plus the transition handle, the same
"widget doesn't need to know the app's types" shape `ScrollController`
already has for `ScrollView`. While transitioning, paints outgoing at the
exit offset and incoming at the enter offset (via `ctx.child(rect)`, the
same primitive `ScrollView`/`Positioned` already use — no new paint
plumbing invented), clipped to viewport; steady-state, paints only the
incoming screen at zero offset, byte-for-byte what handing the widget
straight to `Scaffold::new(...)` produced before this step.
`rsc new`'s `app_rs` codegen template now builds the outgoing screen with
the SAME match arms as the incoming one and wraps both in
`ScreenTransitionView`, in place of handing the current screen straight to
`Scaffold::new(...)`.

**A real, non-obvious bug found via a headless `FrameEngine` test, not
live testing this time**: the first version of `ScreenNav::new`
constructed a BRAND NEW `Arc::new(Mutex::new(ScreenTransition::new(...)))`
on every call instead of persisting it through the same `ctx.state(...)`
hook mechanism `atom`/`previous` already use. Since `ScreenNav::new` runs
on every rebuild, and `push`/`pop` themselves always trigger a rebuild
(they mutate `atom`), the freshly-triggered transition was being silently
discarded and replaced by a fresh, never-triggered one on the very next
rebuild — `is_active()` was permanently `false` no matter what. Root cause
was NOT visible from a shallow test (only checking "did the stack change"
passed); found because the test also asserted BOTH screens' `Semantics`
labels appear simultaneously mid-transition, which failed cleanly and
pointed straight at the real bug. Fixed by persisting `transition` through
`ctx.state(...)` too.

**Verified for real**: two new `rosace/src/engine.rs` integration tests
drive an actual headless `FrameEngine` through a real `MouseDown`/`MouseUp`
click on a "push" button — one confirms BOTH the outgoing and incoming
screens' `Semantics` labels are present in the SAME frame's collected
semantic tree mid-transition (real proof the dual-paint wiring works, not
just that the nav stack changed), settling to only the incoming screen's
label after enough frames; the other confirms animations-disabled means
an immediate switch with no second screen ever painted. Also scaffolded a
fresh `rsc new` desktop app, confirmed it compiles and runs with no visual
regression on the steady-state screens, and the user manually tested the
live app and confirmed the slide transition itself is visually working.
Full `cargo build --workspace` / `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`
clean throughout, including a full clean run with zero failures (even the
`rosace-state` pre-existing flake didn't trigger that run).

### Step 5 — Hero / shared-element transitions (new 2026-07-09)
Confirmed genuinely greenfield (grepped "hero"/"shared_element"/"morph" —
zero real hits). Depends on Step 3 landing first (needs its transition
progress signal to interpolate against).

Revives the existing-but-completely-dead `Key`/`Element::with_key`
identity primitive (`rosace-core/src/{types,element}.rs` — no widget has
a `.key(...)` builder today, and the reconciler never reads it; today's
real identity, confirmed in `walk_element`/`RenderTree`, is purely
positional and resets every navigation) as a widget-facing `.hero_tag(id)`
builder. A new `HeroController` captures a hero-tagged widget's world
rect + `Picture` right before its screen is pruned from the render tree
on navigation, then paints it at the LERP'd rect between outgoing and
incoming positions via the existing overlay-layer mechanism
(`overlay_api.rs`) while Step 3's transition is in progress. Fully opt-in
— no tag used, no behavior change.

Exit: a real running app with two screens sharing a `.hero_tag(...)`'d
image shows it visually morphing between their rects during a push
transition, verified via a real screenshot sequence across frames.

**Landed.** Confirmed via a fresh audit before writing code that `Key`/
`Element::with_key` (`rosace-core/src/{types,element}.rs`) is real but
completely dead — no widget builder ever sets it, and `walk_element`
(`rosace/src/lib.rs`) never reads `NativeElement.key`/`ComponentElement.key`
at all; today's real node identity is purely positional (`RenderTree::slot`'s
per-parent cursor, `rosace-widgets/src/tree/render_tree.rs`). Reviving it
for Hero identity would have meant teaching the walker and the render-tree
arena to key off it — a much bigger, riskier change than this step needed.
Instead: Hero identity is a NEW, separate, purely out-of-band mechanism
(a tag-keyed thread-local registry, `rosace-widgets/src/tree/hero.rs`) that
never touches node identity or the reconciler at all — `Key` stays exactly
as dead as it was found; not revived, not extended, correctly left alone
per this phase's "verify, don't assume" discipline.

**How it works**: a new `.hero_tag("id")` widget wrapper (`Hero`/`HeroApi`,
`rosace-widgets/src/tree/hero_tag.rs`) is a total pass-through outside a
transition — zero behavior/cost change, matching the phase's "no new
widget opts in to anything by default" migration rule. `ScreenTransitionView`
(Step 3's widget, which already paints BOTH the outgoing and incoming
screens' full widget trees every animating frame — no new "keep the old
tree alive" mechanism needed, it was already alive) sets a thread-local
role flag (`Outgoing`/`Incoming`) immediately before painting each side.
Any `Hero`-tagged widget that paints while a role is active captures its
own world rect + a standalone `Picture` (via the existing `PaintCtx::capture`
already used by `RepaintBoundary`) INSTEAD of painting itself in place, and
registers it under its tag — the "hide the real one, capture a snapshot"
half of the standard Hero/shared-element recipe. After both sides finish,
`ScreenTransitionView` drains the registry, pairs entries sharing a tag
(unmatched tags — no widget with that tag on the other side — are simply
dropped, not an error), and paints ONE floating copy on top of both
screens per pair, at a rect LERP'd between the two captures' rects by the
transition's `progress` (Step 3's `ScreenTransition::update` already
computed this value; it was previously unused).

**The one genuinely new low-level primitive this needed**: a captured
`Picture`'s draw commands only supported translation (`DrawCommand::offset`,
Step 3/D088's mechanism) — a Hero morph needs to change SIZE too (a
thumbnail growing into a full image), not just position. Added
`DrawCommand::morph(src_origin, dst_origin, sx, sy)` (and
`PaintCtx::replay_morphed`, `rosace-widgets/src/tree/mod.rs`) covering
all 12 `DrawCommand` variants — rects/points scale exactly; radius/stroke-
width/font-size/blur (no independent x/y scale of their own) scale
uniformly by the average of `sx`/`sy`, a documented approximation, not a
gap discovered later.

**Real, deliberate scope limits, not silently glossed over**:
- The floating copy always replays the INCOMING side's captured picture
  (the destination's appearance), not a crossfade between both sides' —
  simpler, and correct for the common case (an image morphing between a
  thumbnail and a detail view looks the same on both screens); an app
  wanting a genuine content crossfade (e.g. text that changes) isn't
  served by this MVP.
- Both captured rects are whatever position the underlying screen slide
  put them at THAT FRAME (each screen still slides independently via
  Step 3's own spring), not a single fixed flight path decoupled from the
  screen-level slide — the Hero LERP and the screen slide are two
  independent springs running concurrently, which is a reasonable
  approximation, not a literal Flutter-quality flight path. Both weigh to
  zero at the transition's true start/end (progress 0 or 1), so the
  approximation only shows during the middle of the flight.
- Each screen's own copy of the tagged widget renders NOTHING (a plain
  gap) at its normal position for the transition's duration, since it's
  suppressed in place — no fade/placeholder/reflow around the hole. Fine
  for the common case (an image in a list row / detail header) where nothing
  else depends on that space, not addressed generally.

**Verified for real**: 3 new `rosace-render` unit tests for `DrawCommand::
morph` (rect-to-different-size-and-position mapping, nested-geometry
proportional scaling, identity no-op) plus 2 new `rosace/src/engine.rs`
headless `FrameEngine` integration tests driving a real two-screen
`ScreenNav`/`ScreenTransitionView` push through real `MouseDown`/`MouseUp`
— one confirms a `Hero`-tagged 20x20 widget on the source screen and an
80x80 one with the same tag on the destination screen produce a real
INTERMEDIATE size (sampled via actual rendered pixel counts on a real
`SkiaCanvas`, not render-tree-level assertions — same rigor as
`rosace-render`'s own `blit_rgba` pixel tests) at some frame during the
flight, not an instant jump, and settle to exactly the destination's
natural size; the other confirms a `Hero`-tagged widget outside any
transition renders identically to its untagged inner widget. Both stable
across 5 repeated runs. Also scaffolded a fresh `rsc new` app, added a
real photo `Image::file(...).hero_tag("photo")` at two sizes on two
screens, built and ran it — the Home screen's steady-state (pre-transition)
render confirmed correct with no regression from wiring `Hero`/`HeroApi`
into the crate's public prelude. **Honest gap**: this environment has no
click-automation tool (`cliclick` absent, `System Events` denied assistive
access — confirmed by trying, not assumed, matching the exact gap already
logged in Steps 1-4) to physically trigger the push and capture a live
mid-flight screenshot sequence; the headless pixel-sampling `FrameEngine`
test is the primary proof of the morph's correctness end-to-end through
the real paint pipeline, with the live app screenshot serving as a
steady-state visual-regression check only.
Full `cargo build --workspace` / `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`
clean throughout (the one exception, `rosace-state`'s pre-existing
parallel-test flake — Known Issue #8 — reconfirmed unrelated in isolation;
this step never touched `rosace-state`).

### Step 4 — Image load-in fade
> **REVERTED 2026-07-10 — see D111.** `ListView`'s render-tree nodes are
> allocated positionally (`RenderTree::slot()`), not keyed by data index,
> so this animation's state got reassigned across different images as a
> list scrolled — a real visible glitch, not a preference call. `Image`
> now always renders at `opacity: 1.0` immediately; no default fade. Kept
> below for history; do not re-land this without first fixing the
> `ListView` identity bug (Known Issue #11, `CRATE_CONTRACTS.md`).

`Image`/`ImageWidgetImpl` swaps placeholder→loaded instantly. Adds an
`animate_to`-driven opacity ramp (0→1) starting the frame an image's
pixel data becomes available.

Exit: loading a real image in a running app shows a visible fade-in over
the theme's animation duration, verified via a screenshot sequence across
frames, not just code reading.

**Landed, with a real scope finding: image decoding in this crate is
fully synchronous.** `Image::paint()` (`rosace-widgets/src/tree/
image.rs`) does `std::fs::read` + `tiny_skia::Pixmap::decode_png` INLINE
on every single paint call, with no caching — confirmed by reading the
whole file, not assumed. The `ImageCache` type
(`rosace-widgets/src/image.rs`) that would make a real async loading gap
possible exists but is completely orphaned, referenced by nothing in the
real paint path — the same "duplicate/orphaned parallel implementation"
pattern already flagged for `rosace_scroll::ScrollView` (Step 2) and
`Navigator`/`NavigatorAnimated` (Step 3). So there is no genuine
placeholder→loaded async gap to cross-fade across today. What this step
fades instead is the honest thing actually available: the first frame a
given render-tree node has real decoded pixel content, opacity starts at
0 and eases to 1 — not a true crossfade from a placeholder, since no
"was a placeholder" state is tracked per node.

New primitive `PaintCtx::seed_anim_if_unset(value)` (`rosace-widgets/
src/tree/mod.rs`) was needed because `animate_to`'s own documented
behavior is "first observation snaps straight to target, no
appear-animation" — exactly wrong for a fade-in. `seed_anim_if_unset`
sets the node's persistent `anim` scalar to `value` ONLY if it has never
been observed (`None`), leaving an already-set value untouched; calling
it with `0.0` immediately before `animate_to(1.0, ...)` opts a single
node out of the snap-to-target behavior for a real eased appear. New
`DrawCommand::BlitRgba::opacity: f32` field threads this through to
`SkiaCanvas::blit_rgba`, which now scales the blended alpha by opacity
before compositing (both the exact and bilinear-sampled code paths flow
through the same point) — `opacity <= 0.0` short-circuits to a no-op,
`opacity >= 1.0` is byte-identical to the pre-Step-4 behavior. Confirmed
via repo-wide grep this was the only real `blit_rgba`/`BlitRgba` call
site (`custom_paint.rs` only has a stale doc-comment reference), so
making `opacity` a required (not optional/defaulted) field was safe.

**Verified for real**: 3 new `rosace-render` unit tests confirm
`blit_rgba` at opacity 1.0/0.0/0.5 fully-replaces/leaves-untouched/blends
the background correctly. 2 new `rosace/src/engine.rs` headless
`FrameEngine` integration tests (same technique as every prior step) —
one decodes a real PNG through the real `Image` widget and confirms the
very first frame with content is observably mid-fade (not popped in at
full opacity) and later frames ease upward to settle at 1.0; the other
confirms `set_animations(false)` shows full opacity immediately on the
first frame, no fade. Also scaffolded a fresh `rsc new` app, added a real
photo via `Image::file(...)`, ran it live, and screenshotted the
steady-state render — correct, no corruption, confirming the new
`opacity` parameter threading through `BlitRgba` didn't regress normal
image rendering. **Honest gap, same shape as Steps 1-3**: this
environment has no frame-precise capture tooling (no `cliclick`/Quartz,
confirmed absent in earlier steps), and the fade's default duration is
short (~theme's global `duration_ms`, ~160ms) — a live screenshot sequence
did not reliably catch a mid-fade frame in the running app. The primary
proof of the fade's correctness is the headless `FrameEngine` test (which
directly observes the eased scalar's value across frames, stable across
repeated runs), with the live screenshot serving as a steady-state
visual-regression check, not a mid-fade capture.
Full `cargo build --workspace` / `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`
clean throughout (the one exception, `rosace-state`'s pre-existing
parallel-test flake — Known Issue #8 — reconfirmed unrelated by running
`cargo test -p rosace-state` in isolation, passed 2/3 runs, matching its
documented flake pattern; Step 4 never touched `rosace-state`).

## Sequencing

Each step gets its own real-app exit-bar verification before the next
starts — same discipline `PHASE_25.md` followed, and for the same reason:
Phases 24 and 25 both found real, previously-unknown bugs specifically
during real-app verification, not code review. Step 1 is done. Steps 2
and 3 are independent of each other and can be done in either order; Step
4 is independent of everything and can slot in wherever convenient. Step
5 must come after Step 3 (needs its progress signal).

## Migration Rule

No new widget opts in to anything — every change here is inside an
existing widget's own paint/interaction path, governed entirely by the
existing `theme.animation.enabled` switch an app can already flip. No
public API changes expected beyond whatever Steps 2-3's wiring needs
internally.
